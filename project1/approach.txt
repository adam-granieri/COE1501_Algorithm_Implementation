In my implementation of the symbol table I used a De La Brandis (DLB)
Trie with an ArrayList to store predictions and input.

I chose the ArrayList since it was a pre-existing structure that
allows in order data retreival and easy abstracted adding and
resizing functionality over just an array or HashSet.  For example,
When displaying the predictions to the console and making the outWord
I only needed to iterate in order over the ArrayList and display it as
such.  This minimized engineering effort and since the add is O(1),
unless a resize is needed there is not a significant performance loss 
for this implementation.

As for the symbol table I implemented the DLB as shown in class.
